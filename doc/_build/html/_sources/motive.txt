`IphreeqcPy`_  provides a wrapper to communicate with `IPhreeqc`_. It is an alternative to `PhreeqPy`_ and is derived from `PhreeqPy`_. One of the drawback of `PhreeqPy`_ was that it used pythonic names spaces for `IPhreeqc`_  function calls which made `PhreeqPy`_ function calls different from `IPhreeqc`_. Secondly it didnot have automated compilation for `Iphreeqc`_  during installation. As `PhreeqPy`_ I took further liberty to address this issue and redistribute it as `IphreeqcPy`_ to avoid conflicts with development of `PhreeqPy`_. Moreover more Iphreeqc function calls are included in `IphreeqcPy`_ e.g. function calls related to dump which can be of use while restarting simulations.
