`IPhreeqcPy`_  provides a wrapper to communicate with `IPhreeqc`_ in `python`_. 
It is an alternative to `PhreeqPy`_ and is derived from `PhreeqPy`_. 
One of the drawback of `PhreeqPy`_ was that it used pythonic names spaces for
`IPhreeqc`_  function calls which made `PhreeqPy`_ function calls different
from `IPhreeqc`_. Secondly it did not have automated compilation for `Iphreeqc`_  
during installation. As `PhreeqPy`_ is an open source I took further
liberty to address this issue and redistribute it as `IPhreeqcPy`_ to avoid 
conflicts with development of `PhreeqPy`_. Moreover more Iphreeqc function 
calls are included in `IPhreeqcPy`_ e.g. function calls related to dump which
can be of use while restarting simulations.
